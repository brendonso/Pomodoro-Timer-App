# Pomodoro Timer App - Brendon So

Welcome to my android mobile app, This app helps users manage their time with a Pomodoro-style timer, featuring 25-minute focus periods followed by 5-minute breaks. Users can adjust the timer and monitor their progress for improved time management.

## Features

- **Lifecycle Design**: The app is designed with ViewModel and LiveData to manage the timer state, so that the timer continues running when the user exits the app or the app is in the background.

- **Stats**: The stats fragment displays real-time data from the timer fragment on time spent in each mode.
  
- **Controls**: The user can pause or reset the timer, switch between modes, and adjust the duration by increasing or decreasing minutes.
